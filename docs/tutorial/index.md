# Learn CML

Context Mapper Language (CML) is a DSL created by the [Context Mapper](https://contextmapper.org/) project to model end-to-end Domain-Driven Design (DDD), from strategic vision to tactical implementation.

## Introduction {#intro}

This guide will take you through the main components of CML. The complete reference is available in the official [Language Reference](https://contextmapper.org/docs/language-reference/).

### Language Structure

CML allows you to describe three valid modeling levels:

1.  **Strategic DDD**: Context Maps, Domains, Subdomains, and Bounded Contexts.
2.  **Requirements Analysis**: Use Cases, User Stories, and Stakeholders.
3.  **Tactical DDD**: Aggregates, Entities, Services, Events, etc.
4.  **Application Layer**: Commands, Flows, and Coordination.
